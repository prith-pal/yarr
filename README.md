# Yet Another React Repo

A starter kit with the following: 

 - React
 - Page.js as a simple, express style router
 - Stylus
 - ES6
 - Webpack, with Hot Loading (works for both .js, and .styl files)

### Getting started:
 - `git clone https://github.com/prith-pal/yarr.git`
 - Run `cd yarr && npm run init` in terminal. This will watch for changes in your .js, and .styl files.
 - In another terminal, from the yarr/ folder, run `npm run launch`
